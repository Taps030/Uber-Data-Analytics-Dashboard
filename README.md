# 🚖 Uber Data Analytics Dashboard

This repository contains an interactive **Uber Data Analytics Dashboard** built using **Power BI**. It provides visual insights into Uber trip data, uncovering patterns, trends, and operational insights to support data-driven decision-making.

## 📌 Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze Uber ride data and deliver a comprehensive dashboard with KPIs and visuals that highlight:

- Peak ride hours and days
- Popular pickup locations
- Trip volumes by category (e.g., ride type, location, date)
- Heatmaps and time series of ride activity
- Demand forecasting and utilization metrics

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop** (`.pbix`)
- **Data Sources**: Uber ride data (CSV or integrated dataset)
- **Visualizations**:
  - Time Series Charts
  - Maps (Geo-mapping of pickups)
  - Slicers/Filters for interactivity
  - KPIs and custom visuals
